                <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &ldquo;and what is the use of a book,&rdquo; thought Alice &ldquo;without pictures or conversations?&ldquo;&#8230;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Curiouser and curiouser!&rdquo; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); &ldquo;now I&rsquo;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!&rdquo; (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). &ldquo;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; &mdash; but I must be kind to them,&rdquo; thought Alice, &rsquo;or perhaps they won&rsquo;t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I&rsquo;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&rdquo;&#8230;</p>

                <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable&#8230;</p>
